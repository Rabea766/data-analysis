# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## Description
This project explores global COVID-19 data to uncover trends in infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress across different continents and countries.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **T-SQL** (Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Views)

## Key Analysis
1. **Death Likelihood:** Calculated the probability of dying if infected in specific countries.
2. **Infection vs. Population:** Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
3. **Global Numbers:** Summarized total global cases and deaths per day.
4. **Vaccination Progress:** Tracked the rolling count of people vaccinated per country using `JOIN` and `Partition By`.

## How to use
The SQL script contains the full analysis. You can run it on any SQL Server instance after importing the COVID-19 datasets.
